Seive of Erastothenes 
Following is the algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes’ method:

Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to n: (2, 3, 4, …, n).
Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
Starting from p2, count up in increments of p and mark each of these numbers greater than or equal to p2 itself in the list. These numbers will be p(p+1), p(p+2), p(p+3), etc..
Find the first number greater than p in the list that is not marked. If there was no such number, stop. Otherwise, let p now equal this number (which is the next prime), and repeat from step 3.
